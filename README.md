# MetacrafterCreateOwnToken
a smart contract to create your own ERC20 token and deploy it using Remix.

## ERC-20 Tokens Overview
ERC-20 tokens are sets of 'fungible' digital tokens that live on the Ethereum network. Fungible here means that each token in the set is indistinguishable from every other token in the set. This is analogous to how one US dollar is effectively indistinguishable from every other US dollar (at least in the digital realm). When it comes to ERC-20 tokens, each set is differentiated by a ticker symbol like ABC or XYZ. There may be, for example, a set of 1 million ABC tokens, and another set of 10 million XYZ tokens. The barrier to entry for creating ERC-20 token sets is low (it's really just a matter of deploying a relatively simple 'contract' to the Ethereum network), so the number of sets is measured in the thousands. For this reason, most sets actually have very little value. Some, however, are worth billions.
